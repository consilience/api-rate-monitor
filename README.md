# PSR-18 Client Request Rate Monitor

Written initially for a Xero client, this package is a PSR-18 decorator
that monitors and counts API requests, and provides the data needed to
implement throttling.

This package does not perform the throttling itself, but provides details
of how close to a rate limit the requests are, so action can be taken.
Action may include sleeping a process. It may involve redispatching a
process at a later time.

Being a PSR-18 decorator, multiple rules can be layered, so it is possible
for example to monitor both minute-based rate limits and hour-based rate
limits at the same time.

A PSR-6 cache pool is used to cache any time series used to record the requests.
The cache key is provided by the application.
At the moment a client decorator instance handles just one immutable cache key.
A future release may allow the key to be set dynamically by metadata in the PSR-7
request, and that can be provided by the application from any source.

Written for the Xero API, rate limits are set for each organisation an API
makes requests against. So in this case it makes sense to use the organisation
ID as the cache key.
Any further profixes needed to separate these cache keys from other cach items
is the responsibility of the application.

## Rolling Window Monitor Strategy

Only the rolling window rate limit strategy is implemented for now,
but other strategies can be plugged in and pull requests are welcome.

This strategy keeps track of requests at each second within a rolling time window.
Xero allows 60 requests to be sent in any 60 second rolling window.
If 60 requests have been made in the last 60 seconds, then another request will
result in a rate limit rejection.

Let's jump into some code to see how we can protect the application from this.

First we need a cache to keep track of requests, and we use a
[PSR-6](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/) cache.
If using Laravel, the
[madewithlove/illuminate-psr-cache-bridge](https://github.com/madewithlove/illuminate-psr-cache-bridge)
package bridges the Laravel cache to a `PSR-6` interface nicely.

So we get the cache pool:

```php
$cachePool = new MyFavouriteCachePool();

// or inject it into your class if using laravel:

public function __construct(CacheItemPoolInterface $cachePool) {
   ...
}

```

Now we need the `PSR-18` client.
The client can be instantiated however you like.
I use [this Xero API client](https://github.com/consilience/xero-api-client)
to handle authentication against Xero, but it makes no difference which `PSR-18`
client you use.

We will set up the client as `$httpClient`.

Now we use the decorator:

```php
use Consilience\Api\RateMonitor\HttpClient;
use Consilience\Api\RateMonitor\MonitorStrategy\RollingWindow;

// $xeroOrganisationId is the Xero organisation we are connecting to.
// 60 = size of rolling window, in seconds.
// 60 = number of requests that can be made in that window.

$httpClient = new HttpClient(
   $httpClient,
   $cachePool,
   new RollingWindow(60, 60)
)->withKey($xeroOrganisationId);
```

The decorated `$httpClient` can be used as before, but has some additional
methods above the `Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface` interface:

* `getAllocationUsed()` - returns how many requests have been sent in the
   current rolling window.
* `getWaitSeconds()` - tells us how many seconds we much wait before sending
   more requests.

For `getWaitSeconds()` you can tell it how many request you would like to burst,
and it will return the wait time needed to burst that number of requests on one go.

So one strategy for using this may be sleeping before sending the next request:

```php
use Psr\Http\Client\ClientInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\RequestInterface;
use Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface;

function sendRequest(
    ClientInterface $httpClient,
    RequestInterface $request
): ResponseInterface
{
    if ($waitSeconds = $httpClient->getWaitSeconds()) {
        sleep($waitSeconds);
    }

    return $httpClient->send($request);
}
```

That is a naive approach, and assumes a process can simply sleep
for up to 60 seconds without database connections dropping etc.
but it is just a simple example.

# TODO

* Tests.
* Support time resolution rounding for long rolling window periods.
  For example, count the requests per hour for a rolling window lasting
  24 hours.
  The time series for each key will only contain 12 entries to maintain.
* CHECK: do decorators generally pass on methods they don't know about,
  or do they implement the underlying interface they are extending and
  their own additions *only*?
* Support dynamic key detection. A single client with no key set can then
  support requests against many different keys on a request-by-request basis.
  Otherwise we are creating a new decorator class for each key.
  That may also be fine, depending on how the application organises its requests.
